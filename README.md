# ü™ùHAKEN

Normally, running a function yields a single result. With [**HAKEN**](.), you can run a function in a specific context, allowing the function to  register some hooks, which you can then call in response to future events.

```ts
// Setup:
import { buildHooksContext } from 'haken'

const { acceptHooks, hook } = buildHooksContext<{ onMessage: (msg: string) => void}>()

export const onMessage = hook('onMessage')
```
```ts
// Use in functions:
export const createHistory = () => {
  const history = []
  onMessage(msg => history.push({ date: new Date(), msg }))

  return history
}
```
```ts
// Use those functions in a hookable context:

const [history, {hooks}] = acceptHooks(() => createHistory())
hooks.onMessage && source.addListener('message', hooks.onMessage)
```

## Who is this for?

If you are writing a framework, or providing some form of inversion of control, and want to allow _user functions_ (written by someone else) to be able to _hook_ into various aspects of your _host_ code / environment, [**HAKEN**](.) can come in handy.

<br>

## Why?

What [**HAKEN**](.) does can also be achieved by using classes instead of functions. A _user function_ can return an instance (perhaps it is a constructor), which provides methods that your _host code_ can then invoke in response to later events.

The main difference between OOP and the hooks pattern is composability: repeated patterns can be isolated into _custom hooks_, which can arbitrarily invoke the original hooks:

```ts
export const useGreeter = () => {
  onMessage(msg => {
    if (msg.toLowerCase().startsWith('hello')) {
      console.log('Hellow to you sir!')
    }
  })
}
```

With custom hooks, one hook can tap into 2 of the original hooks, another can override a third, and another can add functionality to one of those hooks again. This level of flexibility (and the reusability of logic that comes with it) is pretty difficult to achieve with OOP, specifically when limited by a single inheritance model. Even in a multiple inheritance model, you would need to disambiguate overlapping overrides manually, while the hooks pattern can take care of that based on the more limited scope of hooks (as they are mere side-effects, so they can all be invoked in response to an event).

# Contribution

You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to start and [git](https://git-scm.com) to start.

```bash
# clone the code
git clone git@github.com:loreanvictor/haken.git
```
```bash
# install stuff
npm i
```

Make sure all checks are successful on your PRs. This includes all tests passing, high code coverage, correct typings and abiding all [the linting rules](https://github.com/loreanvictor/haken/blob/main/.eslintrc). The code is typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is used for testing and coverage reports, [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io) are used for linting. Subsequently, IDE integrations for TypeScript and ESLint would make your life much easier (for example, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) supports TypeScript out of the box and has [this nice ESLint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)), but you could also use the following commands:

```bash
# run tests
npm test
```
```bash
# check code coverage
npm run coverage
```
```bash
# run linter
npm run lint
```
```bash
# run type checker
npm run typecheck
```
